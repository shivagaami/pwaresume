       <hr>
       <p>Writing a career objective can be a tricky task – My First Job Survey by Monster.com revealed that a majority of job seekers find the career objective section the hardest part of resume writing (32%). It even outranks explaining a career gap (17%), which is also considered tough.

If you’re searching for your first job, don’t skip this section. Stating your objectives on your resume is especially important because you don’t have enough work history to define your goals. A career objective allows you to highlight personality traits and transferable skills that make you the right fit for the position. By beginning your resume with a quality that makes you valuable to the company, you’ll immediately capture the hiring manager’s attention.

Broadly, a career objective is a short summary telling a hiring manager that you have the relevant skills, abilities and experience to help the company achieve its goals. Placed directly under your contact information and ahead of your education and experience, it’s the first thing a recruiter will see when scanning your resume. Get it right, and you’ll ensure that your CV makes it to the ‘yes’ pile.

For writing an effective career objective, here are a few key things to keep in mind:</p>
